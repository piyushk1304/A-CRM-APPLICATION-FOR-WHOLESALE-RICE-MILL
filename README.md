Rice Mill CRM Application
Overview
The Rice Mill CRM Application is a comprehensive tool designed specifically for wholesale rice mills to enhance operational efficiency and improve customer relationships. This application provides detailed insights into daily rice sales, inventory, and customer data, enabling owners to make informed decisions and optimize their business strategies.

Features and Functionality
Reporting and Dashboards: Generate detailed reports on daily rice sales, total income, popular rice types, and customer purchasing trends. These insights help owners better allocate resources and plan future developments.

Rollup Summary Fields: Summarizes data from child objects to parent objects within a master-detail relationship. For example, it can display the total value of rice supplied from related supplier details.

Cross-Object Formula Fields: Calculate total payment amounts by referencing fields from other objects. For instance, calculate the total amount owed based on the number of kilograms of rice taken and the price per kilogram.

Validation Rules: Implement error messages to ensure data integrity. For example, the application uses the ISBLANK formula to verify required fields are not left empty.
